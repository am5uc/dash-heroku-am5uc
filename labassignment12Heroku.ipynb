    "According to an article by the Pew Research Center, \"Gender pay gap in U.S. hasn't changed much in two decades\", there has been a wage gap between men and women. Women seem to earn about 82% of what men earned, according to median hourly earnings of both full-time and part-time workers. However, when just looking at workers between the ages of 25 to 34, this gap is smaller. A lot of the gender gap can be addtributed to differences in education, occupational segregation, and years of work experience. Women do work in a lot of lowerpaying occupations. Balancing family and the work may be another reason, as working mothers feel more pressure to focus on home and children. Meanwhile, working fathers feel more pressure to support thier family in financial terms. In addition, there are more men than women who are bossses or top managers where they work. This overall probably contributes to the wage gap disparity. This information was gathered from https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/\n",
